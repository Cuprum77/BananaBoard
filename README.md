# BananaBoard
This is small and simple printed circuit board (PCB) designed to help you connect your breadboard projects to power supplies using the standard 4mm banana plugs.
The PCB has a set of male headers that fit into the [BB830](http://www.busboard.com/BB830T) breadboard that [Ben Eater](https://eater.net/) uses, but also uses a slot design to allow wider ranges.
